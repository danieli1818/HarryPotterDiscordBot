  "description": "The Unicorn was a white horse with a horn sticking out of its head. An iconic creature of magic, the existence of unicorns was one of the worst-kept secrets of the wizarding world, as unicorns were inextricably associated with magic in the Muggle world. These majestic equines possessed potent magical properties, with their tail hairs being designed by Garrick Ollivander as one of the \"Supreme Cores,\" which was a distinction shared by only two other beasts."
